# File-Encryptor-and-Decryptor
File encryption and decryption is a Java based windows software for both encryption and decryption of files.
The front end is implemented using JavaFx and scenebuilder.
The encryption and decryption implemented here is mere bit manipulation. 
A stronger encyption and decryption algorithm can improve the project.
